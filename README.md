An open-sourced solution for consumer internet services. 

***This project is in an alpha state. This means that only some (or none) of these features are currently working.***

## Proposal

#### For the Consumer
The internet is big. *Too* big. If you want to get simple updates on your favorite public figure or just talk with your friends, there are numerous internet services that you need to sign up for to see everything. Managing all of these services takes usable time out of your day. Why switch between apps when you can just have one? Take a look at how it works below. 

#### For the Marketer
Managing internet services can easily be done nowadays with a dedicated team or by using a software like Hootsuite. But there's a problem. Not all of your users are part of all of the platforms you manage. Also, are you connecting with all of your users in the more effective way possible? Take a look at how it works below to find out more.

## How it works

***|**  = A note regarding the point above it.*

1. Create an account.
   - Or you can create an account with one (or more) of these services:
      - Google
      - Facebook
      - Twitter
      - Instagram
      - Snapchat
      - Messenger
      - Discord
      - Twitch
      - Mixer
      - Linkedin
      - Pintrest
      - Vimeo
      - Skype
      - Microsoft
      
        **|** Because Open is an individual service, when you login with one (or more) of the following services above, Open will only use this to fetch information from that service to complete your account creation. After, the service(s) that you choose to login with will not be linked to your account.
     
     **If so...** After loging in with one service, other services may be shown that may be able to provide more information to completing (or adding) more information to your account. If you do not provide Needed Information to create an account, you will: 
     1. Not be able to register
     2. Your abilities on the service will be limited
     
   - If you do not choose to create an account with a service, you will provide Needed Information.
   
2. Verify your account

## Why Open?
1. Open is *Open Sourced*. This means that: 
   - Every feature on our platform is free 
   - Anybody can contribute to building the platform
   - We are a nonprofit that aims to benefit ***you***
2. Open is constantly evolving. You can request a feature and we'll add it. Open not only takes those ideas of other apps and incorperates it in itself, but also has a variety of features that make it better choice than competitors.
3. Speaking of competitors... Open is against some of biggest companies in the world. Every service that you can login with in our list above is an important competitor in the world of computers; most notably Google.
